/*
 * card_scan.c - Magic_ScanCards: run every in-play card's own handler for one event.
 *
 * MAGIC.EXE 0x00473f06, DUEL.EXE 0x0048c5a8. The duel engine's central dispatcher: card behaviour lives in per-card
 * handler functions (one pointer per master record, +0x10), and almost every rules question is answered by scanning the
 * cards and letting each one react to an event code (docs/SYMBOL_VERIFICATION.md). Written from the decompiled body
 * (identical in both programs apart from addresses) and checked against the disassembly: every compare is signed.
 *
 * The handlers are the hundreds of per-card scripts and are not native: each is reached through vm_call_at with the
 * address read from memory. Paths the original ends in an assert or a fatal error (a scan nested ten deep, a card index
 * out of range) are not implemented here and stop the run.
