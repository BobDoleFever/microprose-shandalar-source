/*
 * ai_eval.c - how the AI scores a board: Ai_EvaluateBoard and Ai_PenalizeCounterattack.
 *
 * The AI plays by random rollouts (docs/SYMBOL_VERIFICATION.md, "The AI"): it plays out a trial, then scores the resulting board
 * with Ai_EvaluateBoard(player), a signed zero-sum number (about 3,000 calls in a two-second search). The score is a sum over both
 * players of what each is worth: life (a falling amount per point, weighted per player), the lands each player has in each
 * colour, the cards in each player's hand, and for each permanent a value that depends on what it is: a creature on its power,
 * toughness and abilities (and, on the AI's turn, whether the opponent can block or kill it), a land on whether it is untapped,
 * a spell in hand on its cost class. When it is the evaluated player's own turn, Ai_PenalizeCounterattack then lowers the
 * score by what the opponent's best attackers could do back.
 *
 * Written from the disassembly of DUEL.EXE (the decompiled bodies hide casts and divisions; every divide here is the compiler's
 * truncating one, every compare signed), and checked three ways: against vectors recorded from the original and from fuzzed
 * boards, against its own machine code translated by tools/lift on every call of a real game (the host's shadow mode), and by
 * a whole-game comparison with the original. The two programs carry the same code at different addresses (tools/twins/
 * align_addresses.py lined the twins up).
 *
 * Not implemented, where the original reads or writes outside its own locals or is a debugging aid: the on-screen score
 * breakdown (DAT_005ef574 set), more than 16 of one player's creatures in the counterattack's arrays, and an aura whose
 * target index falls outside the 2 x 80 table of attachments.
