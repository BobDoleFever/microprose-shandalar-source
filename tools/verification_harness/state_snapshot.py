"""
Data model for the per-tick state record compared between the port and the original.

This defines *what* we diff, independent of *how* we read it from a live process.
Reading real values (from the port's own memory, or from a Wine process via
/proc/<pid>/mem or a Frida hook) is Phase 1/2 work that needs the toolchain and,
for the original binary, the discs. The shape of the record can be designed and
tested now.

Field names here intentionally do NOT reuse the unverified names from the bulk
rename pass (e.g. we don't assume "g_CampaignDifficultyLevel" means what it says).
Each field lists the source it's cross-referenced against, so we know exactly how
confident we are in what it represents.
