"""
Binary search over two tick-indexed traces to localize the earliest point of
divergence, so a mismatch between the port and the original becomes "state first
differed at tick N" instead of "something somewhere is wrong."

This module is pure algorithm -- it doesn't know how to run the game or take a
snapshot. Callers provide a `snapshot_at(tick)` function for each side (in
practice: replay the same input script up to `tick` against a fresh instance of
each binary, then read state). That's why bisection re-runs from tick 0 each time
rather than pausing a single long-running process: it keeps both sides' timelines
directly comparable and doesn't require pause/resume support from either process.

class NoDivergenceError(Exception):
    """Raised when bisect_divergence is asked to search a range where the two
    sides never actually differ -- almost certainly a caller bug (e.g. passing the
    same snapshot function for both sides)."""

    Assumes monotonicity: once the two sides diverge at some tick, they stay
    diverged for all later ticks. This holds for a deterministic replay of the same
    input script, since a divergence in game state doesn't spontaneously self-heal.
    If that assumption is ever violated (e.g. an incidental divergence that
    resolves itself), bisection will report *a* divergence point but not
    necessarily the true first one -- worth keeping in mind before trusting a
    surprising result blindly.
